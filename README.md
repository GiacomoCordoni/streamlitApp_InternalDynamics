# Streamlit Internal Dynamics

## Overview

**Streamlit Internal Dynamics** is an interactive application designed to analyze and visualize the internal dynamics of multiple stellar populations within 28 Galactic Globular Clusters (GCs). Leveraging high-quality astro-photometric data from ground-based observations, Gaia DR3, and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), this app provides insights into the kinematic behaviors of first-population (1P) and second-population (2P) stars across various regions of each cluster.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualizations**: Explore velocity dispersion and anisotropy profiles of 1P and 2P stars.
- **Comprehensive Data Coverage**: Analyze data from the core to the outskirts of 28 Galactic GCs.
- **Dynamic Filtering**: Select clusters based on properties like dynamical age, Galactic proximity, and more.
- **Statistical Insights**: Understand the significance of observed dynamical differences between populations.

## Dataset

The application utilizes a combination of datasets to provide a robust analysis of multiple stellar populations:

- **Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Photometry**: High-resolution images and photometric data.
- **Ground-Based UBVI Photometry**: Comprehensive surveys providing multi-band photometric information.
- **Gaia DR3 Proper Motions**: Accurate astrometric measurements for proper motion analysis.
- **Gaia XP Synthetic Photometry**: Enhanced photometric data derived from Gaia's low-resolution spectra for select clusters.

All necessary figures and data files required for plotting are organized within the `Data/` directory.
