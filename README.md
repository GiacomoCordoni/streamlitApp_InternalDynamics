# Internal Dynamics of Multiple Populations in 28 Galactic Globular Clusters: A Wide-Field study with Gaia and the Hubble Space Telescope

## Overview

**Streamlit Internal Dynamics** is an interactive application designed to visualize the internal dynamics of multiple stellar populations within 28 Galactic Globular Clusters (GCs). Combining high-quality astro-photometric data from ground-based observations, Gaia DR3, and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), this app provides a wide-field view of the kinematic of first-population (1P) and second-population (2P) stars .

## Dataset
The work combines ground and space-based data to provide a robust analysis of the internal dynamics of multiple stellar populations in Galactic Globular clusters:

- **Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Photometry**: High-resolution photometric data and proper motions for the clusters centres.
- **Ground-Based UBVI Photometry**: Multi-band photometry extending to several half-light radii.
- **Gaia DR3 Proper Motions**: Accurate astrometric measurements.
- **Gaia XP Synthetic Photometry**: Synthethic photometry derived from Gaia's low-resolution XP spectra for select clusters.

All necessary figures and data files required for plotting are organized within the `Data/` directory.
